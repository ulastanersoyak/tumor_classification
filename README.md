# Tumor Classifier

CNN model that can classify given brain MRI images  to 4 classes(glioma tumor, meningioma tumor, no tumor, pituitary tumor)

After 50 epochs it can predict given images with %71 accuracy.

    Place the dataset files in the appropriate directory.


# Usage

```python run.py --image_size <default 256>  --batch_size <default 32>  --num_workers <default 4> --learning_rate <default 0.0001> --epochs <default 20> --transforms <default 1>```

--image_size: The desired size (in pixels) of the input images for the model. The default value is 256.

--batch_size: The number of images to include in each batch during training. The default value is 32.

--num_workers: The number of subprocesses to use for data loading. The default value is 4.

--learning_rate: The learning rate for the model's optimizer. The default value is 0.0001.

--epochs: The number of training epochs. The default value is 20.

--transforms: Determines whether to apply data augmentation transforms during training. Set it to 1 to enable transforms or 0 to skip them. The default value is 1.
